I think that while people might learn differently, the idea that everyone has their own “learning style” is oversimplifying the truth. While study habits or methods of learning might vary from person to person, there are also proven ways to remember information that are universal. I thought that the article made a good point about how people want to compartmentalize themselves by finding out what “type of person” they are. I think that this is true of people in general, even outside of the topic of learning styles so it makes sense that it would apply to learning styles as well. The article made me think about the way that I typically study, and how I could improve on the way that I learn. I find that when I write things down on paper, I’m much more likely to remember them. I’ve always considered myself a reading/writing style learner. I thought this article was interesting because it challenged my view of the “learning styles”, which I had previously thought to be true.
