I really enjoyed the Last Lecture. I thought that Pausch was a very dynamic speaker, and the message of the lecture could be of value to anyone. It was cool to see the VR experiences that Pausch and his students worked on. The “make me a world” VR project especially was very clever and funny. One quote that stuck with me was: “experience is what you get when you didn’t get what you wanted”, which I believe is applicable to everyone. Pausch emphasized learning from experience and working well with others. I thought that Pausch’s emphasis on working well with others and giving people a chance was important as well. Relying on and helping the people that we work with is a huge part of learning and becoming successful. Thinking about Pausch’s message in terms of my current job, I realize that I’ve grown a lot since I first started my job. I’ve always been very timid, and I remember when I first started my job, I was very standoffish toward my coworkers, and they didn’t always have the best opinion of me because of that fact. In the long run, I realized that talking to my coworkers and learning more about them made me happy and made the job more bearable. My work also motivated me to go back to college, giving me another opportunity to grow that I may not have been motivated to do otherwise.
